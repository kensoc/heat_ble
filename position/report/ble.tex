Arduino is an open-source physical computing platform based on a simple i/o board and a development environment that implements the Processing/Wiring language. In this article, we will present a prototype of indoor positioning system using Arduino device and BLE shield which is designed to work with Arduino boards, including Arduino Uno, Mega 2560, Leonardo and Due. It allows us to connect Arduino board with other BLE Central device like a smartphone or tablet.

\section{Introduction}
% no \IEEEPARstart
Arduino is an open-source physical computing platform based on a simple i/o board and a development environment that implements the Processing/Wiring language. Arduino can be used to develop stand-alone interactive objects or can be connected to software on your computer (e.g. Flash, Processing, MaxMSP). BLE Shield stands for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Shield \cite{ble} that is designed to work with Arduino boards, including Arduino Uno, Mega 2560, Leonardo and Due. It allows us to connect Arduino board with other BLE Central device like a smartphone or tablet. Android 4.3 (API Level 18) introduces built-in platform support for Bluetooth Low Energy in the central role and provides APIs to discover devices, query for services, and read/write characteristics.

However, a BLE enabled Android smartphone can discover other BLE enabled devices within range. Android BLE API support getting Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI). RSSI is defined as measured voltage by a receiverâ€™s RSSI circuit. It is the squared magnitude of the signal strength. There are quite a number of RSSI-based localization techniques like triangulation and fingerprinting. None of them are precise in estimation. RSSI values itself affected by many factors like obstacles, multipath fading, antenna polarization and cross-body shielding.


 Often, it is equivalently 
reported as measured power, i.e.,

% exclusively. Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places

% command of the stfloats package.
\section{Mechanisms}

The basic principle of RSSI based positioning techniques describes the relationship between the received signal strength, transmitted power of wireless signals and the distance among wireless devices. The theoretical relationship between RSSI and distance between two devices is the following: \cite{chung2007enhanced}
\begin{equation}
  RSSI = -(10n \log_{10}d + A)
\end{equation}

where, n,d and A are signal propagation constant, distance from sender and received signal strength at 1 meter distance. \\

If d=1, then A=RSSI. For other distances (e.g., d=4) we can get the value of n from measured A and RSSI values from the following equation:

\begin{equation}
 n = -(\frac{ meanRSSI-A}{10 \log_{10}d})
\end{equation}

Here, meanRSSI is the mean of 10 samples of RSSI values obtained from device scan discovery mechanism of Android phone.

\section{Experimentation Setup}

\subsection{Implementation on Android Phone}

Using LG nexus 4 phones and Android development tools, we developed test applications that continuously scan for BLE devices using Android 4.3 BLE API. The GATT profile is a general specification for sending and receiving short pieces of data known as "attributes" over a BLE link. All current Low Energy application profiles are based on GATT. GATT is built on top of the Attribute Protocol (ATT). This is also referred to as GATT/ATT. ATT is optimized to run on BLE devices. Each attribute is uniquely identified by 128-bit format a Universally Unique Identifier (UUID). The attributes transported by ATT are formatted as characteristics and services.

\subsection{Arduino with BLE shield}

Bluetooth Low Energy Shield has been used to interface Arduino with Android device. It works with all Arduino boards, including Arduino Uno, Mega 2560, Leonardo, and Due. 

\subsection{Environment Setup}

The system ~\ref{fig1} consists of two Arduino nodes located at two fixed positions and continuously scanning for Bluetooth LE (BLE) devices in the home area. These two stationary nodes calculate the distance between them and the other Bluetooth LE devices. When the phone moves to the green marks, it send indication to Arduino devices to light on using http request.





\subsection{Calibration}

First, we place one Arduino device 1m distant from Android phone, scan 10 times and store RSSI samples. We take the mean of these RSSI samples and calculate A. Then we place the phone 4m away from the Arduino device, measure the value of n. The same process is repeated for the other Arduino device to determine A and n for that.

\subsection{Distance Calculation}

To estimate the position of the blind node, at least three reference nodes in the network must be

\section{Result}

\section{Analysis}

This work was based on bluetooth positioning. After experimentation, we can conclude that it is not quite as easy as detecting the signal strength. Accurate and precise results depend on many factors, even what kind of phone we used in our experiment, the environment and how it might effect the signal strength, and also obstacles that may interfere with the signal, such as people, walls, tables. Additionally, phone orientation at a particular place experienced different RSSI values.

During address discovery system, the presence of many other devices (that are not part of the system) might 
increases probability of getting accurate and precise RSSI samples. However, as we noticed that the signal strengths significantly varied, we planned to do a lot of calibration. Calibration itself was not sufficient enough to determine the precise distance. Therefore, the RSSI value can estimate distance that might be basic near or far result. 

\section{Conclusion}
The conclusion goes here.
